### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

To some extent. I found it extremely difficult to implement the modal. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I definitely would have spent more time on designing with CSS. Also, I think I could have done better with HTML elements (e.g. when to use a div vs. span, when to nest elements, etc). I also think I could have made my Javascript functions cleaner. I would have loved to complete the stretch goals too.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I was absent for the greater part of project demos, but someone used designed his project with color-changing gradients aand I think that was really pretty.
